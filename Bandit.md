For this level it may be useful to create a directory under /tmp in which you can work. Use mkdir with a hard to guess directory name. Or better, use the command “mktemp -d”. Then copy the datafile using cp, and rename it using mv (read the manpages!)

<img width="1130" alt="bandit level 12" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/140c83b8-ee9f-43ba-82d9-837aad438a45">

THOUGHT PROCESS:

To view the files we use ls command and then we use head command which prints the first lines of one or more files (or piped data) to standard output. And after that we use mkdir command to make a new directory.We use cd command to change the directory,then we use cp command to copy the datafile to present working directory (/tmp/random_dir).then we check that the file is copied or not using ls command. Again we use mv command to rename the file data.txt to data and again we use xxd -r to tell 'xxd' to reverse its operation, attempting to convert a hex dump back into binary data. Then we use the file command to determine the binary file.Then we use mv command to rename the binary file to binary.gz file and use gunzip command to keep original files unchanged but writes the text from a compressed file to the standard output without uncompressing it.Again we use file command to determine the binary file
Then we use bunzip2 command to bind the files into a single file which takes less storage space as the original file use to take.Again we use ls command to check the files and file command to specify the type of file.Then we use mv command to rename the file binary.out to binary.gz and gunzip command to keep the original file unchanged but writes the text from a compressed file without compressing it again we check the files in the directory using ls command then we use file command to specify the type of file.then we use tar -xf command to manage the archieves then we check the files again using ls command and then we use rm command to delete the files . then we use file command to specify the file type of data6.bin then we use the command bunzip2  to bind the files into a single file which takes less storage space as the original file use to take.Again we use ls command to check the files and file command to specify the type of file.Then we use tar -xf command to manage the archieves then we check the files again using ls command and then we use rm command to delete the files and we use file command to specify the type of file and mv command to rename the file and gunzip command to keep the original files unchanged but writes the text from a compressed file to the standard output without compressing it.Again we check the files using ls command and use file command to specify the type of file if it is an ASCII text then we use cat command to read the file which contains the password for the next level.

COMMAND USAGE:

ls : Used to view the files in the system.

head :  prints the first lines of one or more files (or piped data) to standard output.

cp : Used to copy the datafile.

tar -xf : Used to manage the archieves.

rm : Used to delete the files.

cat : Used to read the file content.

**LEVEL 13 TO LEVEL 14:**

LEVEL GOAL :

The password for the next level is stored in /etc/bandit_pass/bandit14 and can only be read by user bandit14. For this level, you don’t get the next password, but you get a private SSH key that can be used to log into the next level.

THOUGHT PROCESS :
We use ls command to check the files and then we use ssh -i to use the private key.Then if it asks for fingerprint confirmation type "yes".We have logged in as bandit14 we can confirm this by looking at your prompt.Get the password for the current user. Logout of the current(bandit 14)session then logout of the bandit 13 sssion and use  the password of user bandit 14 to access next level.

COMMAND USAGE:

ls : Used to view the files in the system or directory.

ssh -i : this command helps to use the private SSH key.

cat : Used to read the file content.

**LEVEL 14 TO LEVEL 15:**

LEVEL GOAL :

The password for the next level can be retrieved by submitting the password of the current level to port 30000 on localhost.

<img width="662" alt="bandit level 14" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2996ee02-7331-44a6-b84f-f2b8dd7b90b7">

THOUGHT PROCESS :
We use cat command to read the file content in /etc/bandit_pass/bandit14.Then we use netcat command to open localhost on port 30000 and use the content we got while using the command cat, then we get the password for the next level.

COMMAND USAGE:

cat : Used to read the file content.

netcat : Used for port scanning and port listening.

**LEVEL 15 TO LEVEL 16:**

LEVEL GOAL:
The password for the next level can be retrieved by submitting the password of the current level to port 30001 on localhost using SSL/TLS encryption.

<img width="561" alt="bandit level 15" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/626076b3-d674-486e-ba06-6d29c5b26306">

THOUGHT PROCESS :

We use cat command to read the file content.We know that we have to connect to an service on port 30,001 using SSL encryption. The simplest way to achieve this is using the openssl command along with s_client which allows to connect to services on our machine using SSL.The password for the current level can be found at /etc/bandit_pass/bandit15
 
COMMAND USAGE:

cat : Used to read the file contents.

openssl s_client : Used to connect to services using ssl.
