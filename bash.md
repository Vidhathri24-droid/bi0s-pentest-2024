In this file we use echo to display the message, we use read command to read the user input and we assign a variable for the user inputs and a variable for output and we assign the resultant output according to the choice of the user.

**TASK 2**

In this shell script it reads a number from the user and displays "It is a palindrome" if it is a palindrome or "It is not a palindrome" if it is not a palindrome.

**TASK3**

Write a script to run the following operations by reading an input and a choice from the user:
ROT13 Encode
ROT13 Decode

In the shell script it reads the user input and change the user input to encoded or decoded rot13 text.

**TASK 4**

Using functions, write a shell script program to check whether a file named “persistence” is present in your system.

The above shell script shows the existence of persistence in the system.
